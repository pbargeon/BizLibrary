<h2>Question 1:</h2>
<h4>What is your favorite programming language and why?</h4>

        C# was the first programming language I learned, and being a child of the 90s, I heavily value nostalgia! I attribute a good amount of my love of the language to that, but I also
        find it easy to use, extremely intuitive, and very powerful. While many languages can fit many roles, I find that C# can adapt itself to so many uses, be they web-based or old school desktop applications.
        It acted as a fine ramp from my early scripting days into learning real object-oriented programming, and will always have a special place in my heart as a result.

        Tabs; Mostly because it's what I taught myself on, but also I appreciate a slightly smaller file size and I find it's far easier on the thumbs.

        I do! My github account is 'pbargeon'. It was created to upload this project, as until now I've mostly absorbed the code of others rather than posted anything myself.

<!-- While hidden links might not be the most flashy or advanced of tricks for an easter egg, I have a sentimental attachment to them, dating back to my first fascination with the internet
    as a place of total freedom in the 90s. When I logged on using my parents' old Compaq Presario, I'd find myself in an endless digital landscape, and hidden on old Geocities and MySpace pages
    were amateur HTML coders thinking themselves particularly clever hiding links in as normal text, often with little extra punchlines to jokes, other times something a little more practical. It
    always felt to me like exploring the hidden alcoves of some fantastical future world, and it's that sort of wonderment and sense of exploration that put me on a journey to learn things like coding
    and without little snippets of mischief like this, I'd probably not have the career I do now, so I felt like it would be a nice little homage as an easter egg here -->
